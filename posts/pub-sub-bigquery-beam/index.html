<main>


<p>I recently got contract job from an adtech startup.</p>

<p>They were using Kafka and Kafka consumers to insert event data into BigQuery.</p>

<p>That setup was running into scaling issues, so they wanted me to replace it with Pub/Sub and DataFlow.</p>

<p>As I understood, they wanted it to be:</p>

<p>a) Cheap (cheaper the pipeline, more margin for the ad tech startup)</p>

<p>b) Reliable</p>

<p>c) Elastic (Handle between 1 billion to 50 billion events per day)</p>

<p>d) Delay in ingestion into BigQuery up to 24 hours is fine.</p>

<h2 id="bigquery">BigQuery</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Streaming inserts cost $0.05 per GB</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this startup does not need real-time ingestion, why pay for it? I want to stretch their runway further by making pipeline as cheap as possible within their requirements. Load job seems fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Load jobs per table per day — 1,000 (including failures). The limit of 1,000 load jobs per table per day cannot be raised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming load job has a failure rate of 50%.
We could push one load job every 3 minutes and still stay within the limit.
To avoid getting throttled we settled on 1 update every 15 minutes per table</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Load jobs per project per day — 50,000 (including failures)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, the startup has 150 customers.</p>

<p>Total jobs per day = 150 * 4 * 24 = 14,400</p>

<p>Assuming, 50% failure rate we need 28800 daily limit to operate.</p>

<p>So, we don&rsquo;t risk running over this limit and surely this can be increased by contacting Google Cloud Platform support later as their documentation has not cautioned against it, unlike the previous limit.</p>

<p>Delay up to 24 hours is fine in our case, so we can just drop frequency if we ran into some issue</p>

<h2 id="cloud-pub-sub">Cloud Pub/Sub</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A message that cannot be delivered within the maximum retention time of 7 days is deleted and is no longer accessible. This typically happens when subscribers do not keep up with the flow of messages</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The default retention time is good enough for our purpose</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cloud Pub/Sub does not currently support replays</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it&rsquo;s not a true Kafka replacement.</p>

<p>I tried looking for hosted Kafka replacements but did find any fully managed price competitive Mongo Atlas like Kafka offering.</p>

<p>This is a startup and they don&rsquo;t have enough people working for them, let alone hiring dedicated people to manage Kafka cluster.</p>

<p>But since Pub/Sub is more elastic and this job specifically demands elasticity (daily events vary from 1B to 50B) and low maintenance, this is a good tradeoff.</p>

<h2 id="dataflow">Dataflow</h2>

<p>First, I started with Python SDK but ran into many limitations. So, I just dropped it and started using Java SDK even tho I&rsquo;ve zero experience working with Java. How hard can it be?</p>

<p>I found both language and SDK quite confusing.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>Now, I just needed code which:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read JSON events from Cloud Pub/Sub</p></li>

<li><p>Load the events from Cloud Pub/Sub to BigQuery every 15 minutes using file loads to save cost on streaming inserts.</p></li>

<li><p>The destination differed based on <code>user_id</code> and <code>campaign_id</code> field in the JSON event, <code>user_id</code> is the dataset name and <code>campaign_id</code> is the table name. The partition name comes from the <code>created_at</code> timestamp field.</p></li>

<li><p>The schema for all tables stays same.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The solution should be flexible enough for use within multiple pipelines. Ideally, just one file which can easily be changed and revision controlled.</p>

<p>And here is what I ended up using (if you see any issues, leave a comment on the gist on GitHub):</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cash-strapped startup and they said they are short on money.
Been there and done that, so I understand their difficulty.
I ended up charging 100 euros for this solution.</p>
